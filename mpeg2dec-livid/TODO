* before 0.2.0 :
	* generic slice yuv2rgb handling, plus nullrgb and sdl implementations
	* clean up frame_t declaration and usage (libvo/libmpeg2) + video_out.h
	* clean up yuv2rgb for interlaced pictures (handling of uv)

* things we dont implement yet
	* dont crash on bad streams, make sure we can resync after a while
		* possible chunk buffer overflow (writing or reading back)
		* destination macroblock overflow
		* MC source out of bounds (maybe signal handler for that one ?)
		* dont just fprintf and exit

* structural optimizations
	* integrate idct_add and idct_copy into the main idct routine
	* do yuv per sub-slice (probably big speed boost)
	* try different memory arrangements for pictures (yuyv, stride, ...)
	* once we have sync, call draw_frame before decoding I or P not after

* local optimizations
	* try feig IDCT instead of MSSG c IDCT ?
	* review the use of static inline functions
	* rework the MC parsing code
	* improve MMX motion comp inner routines
	* optimize IDCT for very sparse input matrixes ?
	* optimize startcode search loop ?
	* bit parsing / DCT parsing optimizations

* clean up
	* clean up header file usage
	* clean up DMV and field MC code

* synchronization stuff
