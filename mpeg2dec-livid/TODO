* things we dont get quite right yet (though we dont see the difference)
	* IDCT routine compliant with IEEE1180
	* display last picture of a stream, etc

* things we dont implement yet
	* field pictures
	* missing MC modes
	* mpeg1 - do oddification, full-pixel MC, D pictures
	* conformance testing
	* dont crash on bad streams, make sure we can resync after a while
	* make the decoder reentrant (if the speed impact is small enough)

* structural optimizations
	* integrate idct_add and idct_copy into the main idct routine
	* get rid of slice structure, put it into picture
	* do yuv per sub-slice (probably big speed boost)
	* try different memory arrangements for pictures (yuyv, pitch, ...)

* local optimizations
	* review the use of static inline functions
	* improve MMX motion comp inner routines
	* optimize DCT for very sparse input matrixes ?
	* optimize startcode search loop ?

* clean up
	* clean up header file usage

* synchronization stuff
