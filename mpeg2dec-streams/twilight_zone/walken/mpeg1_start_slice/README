This stream uses a weird construct at the start of some slices: the
macroblock_address_increment is larger than the picture width, causing
the first macroblock of that slice to be actually on a different
vertical position than that indicated by the slice_vertical_position.

I believe such a construct is incorrect, as the
slice_vertical_position is explicitly defined in both mpeg1 and mpeg2
as being the vertical position of the first macroblock in that
slice. However most decoders, who use the notion of macroblock address
internally, will not notice the weird construct and just decode it
fine.

Additionally this stream also uses the general slice structure, see
mpeg1_slice/README for comments (this is also definitely illegal).
