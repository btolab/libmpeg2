Description: Stresses decoder bandwidth by mixing calls for large amounts
        of compressed data and reconstructed data.

1           Regular I frame picture
2,13,23     P frames with random mix of high bit rate intra macroblocks
            and dual macroblocks with zero DCT coefficients.  The
            first two intra macroblocks in each slice have maximum
            coefficient data; the remaining have half.  The dual
            macroblocks have no coefficient data.  The horizontal
            vector component is always zero.  The vertical component is
            1 in the first slice, -1 in the last slice, and zero elsewhere.
            Delta mv is zero.
3-11,13-22  P frames with maximum number of skipped macroblocks.
