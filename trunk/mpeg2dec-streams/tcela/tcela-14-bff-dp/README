tcela-14 is an SP@ML bitstream designed for testing the syntax and
prediction bandwidth the case of bottom-field first frame-pictures
predicted with dual-prime.

This bitstream can be added to the Video Conformance Testing bitstream
set for the "ID = 3" test.

Parameters are the following:

Bitstream ID:   3
Description:    Frame-coded bottom-field first P-pictures, all dual-prime,
                almost all half-pel
Stresses:       prediction bandwidth
Parameters:     SP@ML, 60 frames (plus a short version with 4 frames)
Organization:   TCE-LA

Bit rate:               15 Mbit/sec 
Sampling dimensions:    720  x 480 x 30 Hz 
vbv_buffer_size:        maximum vbv_buffer_size for SP@ML 
Distribution of bits:   observed rule of maximum 2 macroblocks per row
                        that exceed legal 1.5:1 expansion factor.

Please check that you can decode it.  Thank-you.
