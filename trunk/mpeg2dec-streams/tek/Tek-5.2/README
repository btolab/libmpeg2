Dear Video Conformance Testing AHG,

This is the third short (4-frames) version of Conformance Bitstream ID #4 (All
MB-type transitions).  It fixes the problems reported in earlier versions:

   1) Negative DC coefficient in a B-picture intra block (thanks to Rajesh
      Hingorani (AT&T)).
      
   2) The first P-picture consisted only of forward frame structured macroblocks
      (thanks to Metin Uz (C-cube)).

   3) VBV fullness was set to 0xFFFF (VBR, except in the first picture) due to
      problems encountered trying to rate control a sequence with these
      unusual characteristics (thanks to Jan De Lameillieure (HHI)).


This sequence is generated with the following parameters:

	1) input is "flower garden" test sequence
	2) 15 Mbit/sec data rate
	3) Maximum 1835008 bit VBV buffer
	4) GOP parameters: M=3, N=15.
	5) Picture size 704 by 480 luma pels
	6) Frame rate 29.97 Hz
	7) Double precision IDCT
	8) Frame structured pictures.

Instead of using normal macroblock typing, the test cycles thru all legal
combination of:

	1) Macroblock type (see tables B-2, B-3 and B-4 in DIS).
	2) Skipped macroblock are generated.
	3) All combinations of frame and field DCT for coded & intra MBs
	4) All combinations of Frame-based and Field-based prediction
		for motion compensated macroblocks.

To be more specific, the following tables enumerate the generated macroblock
"types".  The "type" is expanded to include skipped MBs, frame vs field DCT,
and frame vs field motion type.

To generate the test video, the picture is divided into pairs of macroblocks and
all possible combinations of the enumerated type above are generated, except
where such a combination would be explicitly illegal (e.g. skipped macroblock
at the start of a slice or following an intra MB in a B-picture).  In the
illegal cases, the skipped macrblock is replaced by an intra macroblock.

In the case of B-picture the cycle requires 2*35*35 (or 2450) macroblocks to
complete, (more than one B-picture).  In any case, the cycles continue 
independently of picture boundaries.

Skipped macroblock are generated; the target macroblock's motion vectors are
replaced by the encoder's PMVs as required to make it "skipped".  This leaves
horrible block missing artefacts, however the object is to match the decoded
pictures.

The bitstream is "conf4.bit" and the decoded pictures are in "conf4.420".
The format of the decoded pictures is:

	4:2:0 frame ("display" order) 8 bits/component

	              width              
                +---------------+

                |      Y0       | height
                |               |
                | width/2       |
                +-------+-------+
                |  Cb0  |

                +-------+-------+

In order to make an appropriately "evil" bitstream let me know about any
problems, errors or cases which are not covered by the test.
