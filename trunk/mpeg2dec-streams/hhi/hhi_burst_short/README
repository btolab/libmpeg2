Dear AHG for video conformance testing,
Dear AHG for video bitstream verification,

The bitstream package hhi_burst_short.tar contains a new version of 
the proposal for conformance bitstream #12.  It contains the file
"hhi_burst_short.bits".  

The bitstream is the result of coding 4 frames of Kiel Harbour at 15 Mbit/s.
The picture structure is as follows :

   I-frame
   P-frame
   B-frame (burst)
   B-top-field
   B-bottom-field (burst)
  	
There is a burst of 4 slices in the middel or at the bottom of B-frames and
B-bottom-fields.  All vectors in B-pictures are half-pel vectors (they 
require a bilinear interpolation). The motion compensation in the B-frame is always field motion compensation.  In the B-fields, it is always 16x8 MC.

Among the differences between this version and the previous one are :
   * the forced bilinear interpolation for all B-MB's
   * the mixture of picture structures
   * there are no extra ESCAPE-code-words to force the high
     bit rate during the bursts.
   * there is already bidirectional MC in all MB during the burst
     (as agreed in Grimstad, Norway)

The decoded sequence is available on request. 

Please let us know if you have any problems decoding & matching the 
results included here.  Let us also know your opinion, whether this 
bitstreams sufficiently tests what it intends to test.


Best regards,

M. Zhou, J. De Lameillieure
