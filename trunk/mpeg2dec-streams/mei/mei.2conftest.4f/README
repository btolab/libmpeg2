		Conformance testing (ITEM = 2)



Dear Tristan,


We encoded 4 and 60 frames for ID = 2, and put all results into the Exabyte tape.


Following is the description for contents of the tape:

directory name: mei.2conftest.4f
Readme file       :     readme.4f(this file)
Bitstream filename:     mei_2stream.4f
Decoded image filename: mei_2decoded.4f


Description of the bitstream:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4 frames:

Conformance Testing AHG members
Bitstream ID:   2.
Description:    Sequence containing B-picture coded with maximum
vbv_buffer_size: 1.75 Mbit(1,835,008 bits)
Stresses:       VLD
Justification:  A large B-picture located after several smaller coded
                pictures can catch a decoder off guard.
Parameters:     Main Level, 4 frames
Organizations:  Matsushita

Distribution of bits:   observe rule of maximum 2 macroblocks per row
                        that exceed legal 1.5:1 expansion factor.
