* things we dont get quite right yet (though we dont see the difference)
	* IDCT routine compliant with IEEE1180

* things we dont implement yet
	* field pictures
	* missing MC modes
	* mpeg1 (aaron ?)
	* conformance testing

* structural optimizations
	* integrate idct_add and idct_copy into the main idct routine
	* DCT coefficient parsing
	* get rid of slice structure, put it into picture
	* do yuv per sub-slice (probably big speed boost)
	* try different memory arrangements for pictures (yuyv, pitch, ...)

* local optimizations
	* review the use of static inline functions
	* improve MMX motion comp inner routines
	* work on bit parsing (needbits only when necessary)
	* optimize vlc parsing routines
	* optimize DCT for very sparse input matrixes ?
	* optimize startcode search loop ?

* synchronization stuff
