First of all, this is very early code. If you're not interested
in hacking video codecs then there isn't much point in downloading
it. Normally I wouldn't release something this early, but it seems
like there is a lot of interested hackers out there so...

mpeg2dec is the result of me attempting to re-write the slice 
level and below code of the MPEG software simulation groups (MSSG)
decoder. After a few days of pain I decided I was better off 
re-writing the entire thing. I think my code is pretty easy to
read and understand. I'd love to have some feedback on the design.

Here's a hierarchy of how the code fits together:

decode.c
|--parse.c
|-----bitstream.c
|-----getvlc.c
|-----stats.c
|--mb_buffer.c
|--idct.c
|--motion_comp.c
|--display_*.c

For each frame, decode.c uses parse.c to stuff macroblocks into the
macroblock buffer (mb_buffer.c). When this buffer is full or the frame
is done, the main decoding pipeline (idct, motion_comp) 
is run over the contents of the buffer.

Modules with optimized code for a particular architecture have an
_foo suffix (like idct_mmx.c). The appropriate code is selected
at runtime in the case of instructions that aren't always available
supported (like 3dnow or SSE). The philosophy is "one binary->one
architecture".

Stuff that works
- I-type Frame pictures 

Stuff that is broken
- field based pictures
- P,B type pictures  (motion_comp.c needs some filling in)

Stuff that needs to be done
- fix the broken stuff (see above)
- the MSSG getvlc.c needs to be sanitized and turned into vlc.c
- motion.c need to be sanitized and pulled into parse.c 
  (in cvs 'bp_frames_branch')
- make it really fast :)

Patches

If you manage to fix bugs or add features to mpeg2dec, please send a 
patch to <aholtzma@ess.engr.uvic.ca>. Patches must be in 'diff -urN'
format. Also, if you send me assembly, it must be in AT&T format and
preferably inline assembly. Special ISA extensions (like 3dnow,MMX)
should be #ifdef'ed with the appropriate _ISA_, not the extension.
You should also include a test to determine if you extension is present
and set the appropriate function pointers.

How to use mga_vid from scratch

1. mknod /dev/mga_vid c 178 0
2. ./configure
3. if you have a g200 you might want to change the memory size in 
   mga_vid.c to 8 megs.
4. make
5. su 
6. /sbin/insmod videodev; /sbin/insmod drivers/mga_vid.o  (you must have 
   v4l built for your kernel)
7. ./mpeg2dec foo.mpeg2  (you're done!)

How do I know if mga_vid works on my system?
  
There is a test application called mga_vid_test. This test code should
print out info on the console about your specific card (G200 or G400,
as well as RAM size).  RAM size autodetect was only tested on a G200,
8MB so far... Also it should draw some nice 256x256 images for you,
if all is working well.
