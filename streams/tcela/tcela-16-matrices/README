tcela-16 is an MPEG-1 constrained-parameter bitstream designed for testing
that MPEG-2 (and MPEG-1) decoders implement properly quantization matrices,
i.e. that they do not accidentally use the transposed matrices.

This bitstream will be added to the MPEG-2 Video Conformance Testing bitstream
set.  There is not ID yet defined for this test.

Note:  MPEG-1 constrained-parameter bitstream like this one should be
decodable by all MPEG-2 compliant decoders.

Parameters are the following:

Description:    A bitstream with custom quantization matrices that
are not symetrical at all;

The matrices are so asymetrical that an incorrect implementation is
visually obvious (the reconstructed frames will look terrible).

Stresses:       nothing - checks correct implementation of quantization matrices
Parameters:     MPEG-1, 31 frames
Organization:   TCE-LA

Bit rate:               1.856000 Mbit/sec 
Sampling dimensions:    352  x 240 x 30 Hz 
vbv_buffer_size:        327680 bits 

Please check that you can decode it.  Thank-you.
