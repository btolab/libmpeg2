Dear AHG on video conformance testing,

This is the Norwegian Telecom Research bitstream with low delay and
skipped (repeated) pictures (compliance bitstream #18). It was made
from MobCal and FlowerGarden at 720x576x25 Hz. The sequence contains
19 frames MobCal + 19 frames FlowerGarden + 21 frames MobCal. The
frames after each scene change were encoded as intra frames. Otherwise
intra slice updating has been used. Frames have been skipped after
each intra frame. The bitrate is 15 Mbit/s, and the profile and level
is SP@ML. Dual Prime is used in every P-frame, and the low delay bit
is set. The file "ntr_skipped.plot.ps" contains a plot of the VBV
buffer content on the output of the encoder.

The format of the decoded pictures is as usual:

        4:2:0 frame ("display" order) 8 bits/component
        width : 720 pels/line
        height : 576 lines/frame

                      width              
                +---------------+       
                |               |          
                |      Y0       | height
                |               |
                | width/2       |

                +-------+-------+
