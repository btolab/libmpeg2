mcp10ccett.bits is an MP@ML bitstream designed for testing that decoders
implement properly the motion compensated prediction stages.

This bitstream corresponds to conformance test bitstream ID #10.

Parameters are the following:

Bit rate:               4 Mbit/sec 
Sampling dimensions:    720  x 576 x 25 Hz 

Please check that you can decode it.  Thank-you.
