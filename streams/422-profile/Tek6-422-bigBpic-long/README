Dear 4:2:2 profile conformance bitstream exchange AHG members,

This is the long version of 4:2:2 profile test bitstream ID 2.  This sequence
contains 20 very large B pictures (almost one full VBV buffer of 9437184 bits).
The purpose is to stress the VLD.  To make this test more demanding, all
macroblocks in the big B picture are coded using bi-directional motion
compensation.

The parameters for the sequence are as follows:

Sequence:	29.97Hz, "Mobile & Calendar", 4 frames, IBBP
Bitrate: 	50 Mbits/sec
VBV size: 	9437184 bits
Picture size:	720 x 486 (rounded up to 720 x 512)
Quant. scale:	Non-uniform (q_scale_type 1)
Picture struct:	Frame
Extras:		Sequence display extension,
		Copyright extension (with copyright authority and
		   copyright number being fictitious), 
		Lausanne slice extra information byte,
		Intra DC precision of 11 bits.

The large B pictures in display order are (counting from 0 as the first
picture):

	1, 8, 16, 23, 31, 38, 46, 53, 61, 68, 76,
	83, 91, 98, 106, 113, 121, 128, 136, 143

The large B-pictures are generated by forcing encoder to output 24-bit escape
sequences while using the minimum quantizer_scale.  Note that many macroblocks
in the big B picture exceed the MP@ML restrictions on bits/macroblock:  If all
blocks consist of 64 24-bit escape sequences, the total number of DCT
coefficient bits is 17694720 which is less than two maximum size VBV buffers.
Also note that there are many blocks which have IDCTs of zero in the large
B pictures, especially in the chrominance compenents; it was necessary to
include these zero block to make the B-pictures "large".

The format of the picture data is:

	4:2:2 frame ("display" order) 8 bit samples per compenent.

	width  = 720
	height = 512

	NOTE: There is a black stripe (26 lines high) on the bottom of the
	      coded picture due to the round up from a height of 486 to 512.
