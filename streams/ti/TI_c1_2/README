Dear Video Conformance Testing AHG,

The following bitstream and associated decoded pictures is generated 
according to the Conformance Bitstream ID #1 ( All field, interpolated
MC for B pictures). This bitstream is generated with the following
parameters:

        1) 4 frames, IPBB,  of "Football" sequence
        2) M=3, N=15, 
        3) frame rate = 30
        4) bit_rate = 4000000
        5) vbv_buffer_size = 1750000
        6) Picture size: 704 x 480

The bitstream is "TI_c1.bits" and the decoded 4:2:0 pictures are in
"TI_c1.420". The file of the decoded pictures contains 4 frames of the
following format:

        
               704

Please let me know if you have any problems decoding the bitstream.
