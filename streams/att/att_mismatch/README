Subject: IDCT mismatch bit stream

Dear Chad,

I am enclosing a uuencoded version of the bit stream AT&T is
contributing to the MPEG conformance IDCT mismatch test.

The source images consist of 132 frames of size 32x32.
The luma of the first 100 frames are time varying random noise,
and the last 32 frames are stills of 128 flat gray level.
All chroma has value 128.

The first frame is encoded as I frame and
all subsequence frames are P frames.
All macroblocks in P frames are forced to be non-intra.
and coded with no MC (i.e. motion vector = 0).
All elements in Q-matrices have value of 8,
and q_scale is fixed to the value of 2.
 
We suggest to run the bit stream through a double precision IDCT
"reference decoder".
Then measure the MSE, maximum absolute pixel error, or any other
distortion metric, of the last frame (frame 131) reproduced by the
decoder-under-test with reference to the last frame reproduced by the
reference decoder.
 
Different decoder implementations can be ranked by
the distortion values measured from the last decoded frame.
 
The threshold for passing or failing is open to discussion .....

Please let me know if you have any question.

Regards,
Siu-Wai Wu.
