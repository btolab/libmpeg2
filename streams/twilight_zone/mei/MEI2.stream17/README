Dear Bitstream Exchange & Video Conformance Adhoc Group members, 



Matsushita Conformance Bitstream No:17 (Version 2)
---------------------------------------
MEI2.stream17 is a bitstream containing the concatenation of two bitstreams
of different sizes and bitrates.   
This is similar to the previously sent MEI.stream17, with a minor correction
on one of the mv values.

The following are detail
description of the bitstream :

Sequence 1
----------
a) flower garden at CCIR size.
b) size : CCIR 601 (704x480)
c) bitrate : 4 Mbps
d) number of frame : 4
e) frame structure : IBBP frame coding
f) decoded picture file : firstseq.image

Sequence 2
----------
a) football 
b) size : 256x256
c) bitrate : 2 Mbps
d) number of frame : 4
e) frame structure : IBBP frame coding
f) decoded picture file : secondseq.image

Sequence 1 is followed by sequence 2, with a sequence_end_code in between
the sequences.  
vbv_delay value is inserted in sequence 2 assuming the bit rate of sequence 2.

Your decoding results and comments for the bitstream will be very
much appreciated.

Thank you very much.


Best Regards

------------------------- Specification of 17 ---------------------------------
Bitstream:          17
Title:              Concatenated sequences of different picture sizes with 
                    VBV continuity.
Profile and Level:  MP@ML of differing sampling dimensions and bitrates 
                    for each of the N concatenated sequences.
Description:        Concatenated sequences of different picture sizes with 
                    VBV continuity
Functional stage:   controller
Purpose:            Realistic decoders will encounter concatenated sequences 
                    where each sequenece will possess different bitstream 
                    parameters (frame dimensions and rates).
Parameters:         2*4 and 2*60 frames
Organization:       Hitachi & Matsushita

The format of the decoded pictures is as usual:
        First Sequence :
        ================
        4:2:0 frame ("display" order) 8 bits/component
        width : 704 pels/line
        height :  480 lines/frame
 
                      width              
                +---------------+
