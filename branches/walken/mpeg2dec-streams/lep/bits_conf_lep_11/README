This directory contains the files related to the conformance testing
of MPEG2 video decoders. The conformance test is the # 11 :

  Bitstream ID:   11
  Description:    Flat distribution of VLC events (worst case for constant 
                rate symbolic VLDs)
  Stresses:       VLD
  Justification:  Badly designed systems will rely on statistically low count
                of symbols over global areas to meet real-time constraints.
  Parameters:     Main Level, 4 frames
  Organizations:  TCE-LEP
             
Included files
--------------
  bits_conf_lep_11.bits is the compressed video file
  bits_conf_lep_11.file is  the file that contains the decoded pictures
  bits_conf_lep_11.log is the log file of LEP decoder

Bitstream characteristics
-------------------------
