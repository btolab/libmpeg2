Nokia6_dual is an MP@ML bitstream created for Video Conformance Testing AHG,
test item 3. 

	Bitstream ID:   3.
	Description:    All dual-prime macroblocks in frame-coded picture
	Stresses:       prediction bandwidth
	Justification:  prediction bandwidth is at a maximum in this mode
	Parameters:     Main Level, 4 frames
	Organizations:  Nokia, Toshiba


        MOB&CAL,  720 * 576 * 25 Hz
        15 Mbit/s
        Frame structured pictures.
        I P P P  (four frames)
        Intra DC 8 bits
        Only dual prime  prediction.
        Frame/field IDCT (double precision).
	VBV size 1835008 bits


The following files are enclosed:
bitstream file (4 frames)	nokia6_dual.bit
decoded image file (4 frames)	nokia6_dual.decoded
trace file (4 frames)		nokia6_dual.trace
bitstream file (60 frames)	nokia6_dual_60.bit


Nokia6_dual_60.bit ia a 60 frames long bitstream, which has been
encoded using the same parameters.

Nokia6_dual.trace contains data only from the topmost slice. More
complete trace files are available upon request.


The decoded images are in the usual format:

                     720

I would appreciate it if you could try to decode this, and compare the
results with our decoded images. Please let me know if you have problems
with the bitstream.
