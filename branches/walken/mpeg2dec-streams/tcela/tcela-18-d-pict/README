tcela-18 is an MPEG-1 bitstream designed for testing that MPEG-2
decoders can decode properly MPEG-1 D-pictures bitstreams.

This bitstream will be added to the MPEG-2 Video Conformance Testing
bitstream set.  There is not ID yet defined for this test.

According to the MPEG-2 Video IS (section 8.1), Simple, Main, SNR
scalable, Spatial scalable and High profile decoders at Main level or
better shall be able to decode this bitstream.

Parameters are the following:

Description:    An MPEG-1 bitstream with D-pictures;

Stresses:       nothing - checks correct implementation of MPEG-1 D-pictures
Parameters:     MPEG-1, 31 frames
Organization:   TCE-LA

All parameters are within the range defined for Main Level of Main Profile.
Bit rate:               2.0 Mbit/sec 
Sampling dimensions:    720  x 480 x 29.97 Hz

Please check that you can decode it.  Thank-you.
