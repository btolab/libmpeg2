tcela-17 is an MPEG-2 SP@ML video bitstream designed for testing that
decoders handle properly motion vectors that reach the maximum range
allowed for the profile-and-level.

The test can be asserted visually by checking that there is no red area
in the second reconstructed frame.  This frame should look like an array
of dark dots on a grey background. Note that the first reconstructed frame
is mostly red, except for three dark dots.

This bitstream will be added to the MPEG-2 Video Conformance Testing
bitstream set.  There is not ID yet defined for this test.

Parameters are the following:

Description:    A bitstream with motion vectors reaching the maximum of the
authorized range for the profile-and-level used;

Stresses:       nothing - checks correct implementation of motion vectors
decoding and of prediction.
Parameters:     2 frames
Organization:   TCE-LA

Bit rate:               variable, Max 5.0 Mb/s 
Sampling dimensions:    720  x 480 x 29.97 Hz 

Please check that you can decode it.  Thank-you.
