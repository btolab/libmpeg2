tcela-15 is an SP@ML bitstream designed for testing that decoders
can handle properly bitstreams that contain a lot of stuffing.

This bitstream will be added to the Video Conformance Testing bitstream
set for the "ID = 28" test.

Parameters are the following:

Bitstream ID:   28
Description:    A bitstream with a lot of zero byte stuffing;

In the first half of the bitstream, at one of the legal positions in
the bitstream, there will be at least 0.9*VBV_buffer_size zero bit
stuffing

In the second half of the bitstream, there will be in each picture, at
a legal position, between R/P and 0.9*R/P zero bit stuffing (R=maximal
bit rate of the bitstream ; P=picture rate of the bitstream)

Stresses:       parser
Parameters:     SP@ML, 61 frames, low_delay=0
Organization:   TCE-LA

Bit rate:               15 Mbit/sec 
Sampling dimensions:    720  x 480 x 30 Hz 
vbv_buffer_size:        maximum vbv_buffer_size for SP@ML 

Please check that you can decode it.  Thank-you.
